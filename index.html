<p>I'm a PhD student in NYU's philosophy department.</p>

<p>I work in moral and social/political philosophy. My dissertation is about the idea that workers should be rewarded according to their productive contributions. I argue that, despite appearances, this idea cannot vindicate significant income inequality--that it has egalitarian implications, rather than inegalitarian ones.</p>

<p>I did my undergraduate degree in politics at the University of Virginia followed by an MPhil in political theory from Oxford. Before coming to NYU I was special advisor for opioid policy / acting director of opioid overdose prevention at the Baltimore City Health Department.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>. My last name is pronounced "burl."</p></p>
