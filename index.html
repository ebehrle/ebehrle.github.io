<p>I am a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows. I received my PhD from the NYU Department of Philosophy in the summer of 2025.</p>

<p>I work in moral and social / political philosophy. My current project is about the old idea that workers should be rewarded according to their productive contributions. I argue that, despite appearances, this idea cannot vindicate significant income inequality—that it has egalitarian implications, rather than inegalitarian ones.</p>

<p>I did my undergraduate degree in politics at the University of Virginia followed by an MPhil in political theory from Oxford. Before coming to NYU I was special advisor for opioid policy / acting director of opioid overdose prevention at the Baltimore City Health Department.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>. My last name is pronounced "burl."</p></p>
